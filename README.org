* librusrestapi - An open source REST API for Librus Synergia

[[https://librelibrus.herokuapp.com/api/][Swagger documentation here!]]

Goal of this project is to free students from the limitations of Librus Synergia software
mainly: giving the user *fresh* information unlike their mobile app that can only
refresh every *3h* or so.

Check out my other project that was used here: [[https://github.com/ravensiris/librusapi][librusapi]]
